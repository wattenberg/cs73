  <h2> Learning objectives and outcomes</h2>

This course is meant to teach students basic concepts in computational generative art, and provide a foundation for creative self-expression via software. Students should come away with an appreciation for the opportunities in using data as a medium, as well as technical and ethical challenges. In addition, they should gain an understanding of the critique process 
<p>
By the end of the course, students should have:
<ul>
<li>Ability to create expressive graphical, interactive applications that can be deployed on the web, using either the p5.js environment or Javascript/HTML
</li><li>
Ability to participate in the in-person critique process: assessing a composition, articulating useful criticism, and receiving feedback constructively.
</li><li>
Ability to assess data quality and think critically about how data sets have been constructed and used. Ability to clean and prepare data. 
</li><li>
Familiarity with key concepts and themes of generative and data-driven artwork
</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="course-components">Course Components</h2>


This is a studio course, following the tradition in design and art schools of learning by doing, and learning by critique. Given the nature of the class, students are likely to bring widely different backgrounds and perspectives to bear on the material; our teaching philosophy is that we want students to uncover their own strengths, and use those as building blocks for learning material that they may not otherwise have confidence to tackle.

<h3 id="live-classes">In class</h3>
<p>The general structure of the class will be to introduce a new topic on Thursday, with a related homework exercise due the following Tuesday. We will spend much of that Tuesday on an in-class critique and discussion of the group's work.</p>

<strong>Lectures</strong> Class lectures will introduce central concepts related to software-based art and data visualization. As a class, we will examine, analyze, and critique a variety of contemporary and historical pieces based on data and algorithms. We'll also spend time on craft: the technicalities of graphical coding and working with data.
<p>
<strong>Critiques</strong> A core element of the class will be structured critiques of homework exercises. To be clear, we don't mean "critique" in the sense of making negative comments. Instead, a critique is a rigorous and intellectually curious examination of the work. Engaging in this process is not just an excellent way to deepen understanding of the subject at hand, but builds skills that are helpful in many other contexts. 




<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>There will be weekly homework assignments, which will usually consist of a series of prompts. Students will create a draft composition for each prompt, along with a brief paragraph describing their intentions. We'll go over these drafts in a group class critique. A final version of the compositions will be due by the following class.

<h3>Topics covered</h3>

This is a conceptual list of topics. Please see the <a href="schedule.html">course schedule</a> for precise dates of lectures, homework, etc..

<p>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Homework 2</strong>: Two series of 3 grayscale compositions, each expressing three different emotions 
<ol>
<li>Circles series: Emotion A is represented by 2 circles, emotion B is represented  100 circles, and emotion C is represented by 100,000 circles.</li>
<li>Lines series: Emotion A is represented by 2 lines, emotion B is represented  100 lines, and emotion C is represented by 100,000 lines.</li>
<li>Post links to each of these series.</li>
</ol>
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Color</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lecture topics</strong> Coordinates used in psychology and computing. Readings from Albers. Gerhard Richter.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Homework 3</strong>: Abstract portraits of the personalities of three people you are close to.
<ol>
<li>Your portrait must be 1000x1000 pixels, divided into a 10x10 grid of squares, each with a side of 100 pixels. </li>
<li> The only thing you’re allowed to vary is the color of each square.</li>
<li>Post links to each of these series.</li>
</ol>
</ul>



<p>
<h4>Animation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lecture topics</strong> Parametrized position. 
Simple Javascript objects; particle animations.
In addition to technical readings on p5.js site, reading on Alexander Calder.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Homework 4</strong>: Create an abstract clock.
<ol>
<li>It can tell time however you want—as long as you can explain to the class how to read it</li>
<li>Post links to each of these series.</li>
</ol>
</ul>


<p>
<h4>Interaction</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lecture topics</strong> Working with mouse and keyboard. Readings from Code as Creative Medium about interactive projects.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Homework 5</strong>: Make two simple games. 
<ol>
<li>One should be easier than it looks.</li>
<li>One should be much harder than it looks.</li>
</ol>
</ul>



<p>
<h4>Data</h4>
<ul>

<li>In the other composition, the data should be used to create the visuals, but make it so a typical viewer would have no idea what the data source is.</li>
<li>The two compositions should be so different that someone couldn't tell they are from the same data set</li>
<li>Find a purpose to obfuscation; don't let it just be a formal exercise.</li>
